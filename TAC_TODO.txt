(DONE) fix the bug with contributors
(DONE) properly extract package names from multipackage repositories (check npm URL)
(DONE) deploy GHTorrent and implement MTI using it
add rolling-max parameter to fano factor (or events?)
(DONE) extract package quality/maintenance/popularity scores (for 34k packages)

==============================

- (DONE) get list of users and roles when they first took it.
    who to count: three flags: collaborators, contributors, users (default: all True)
        get issue/pr/commit events, associated with user names and roles

- (DONE) for co-commit network, add custom granularity (only month and week)


- (DONE) issue events should accept the same customization as fano factor
- (DONE) fano factor - get a single number, accept timestamp, length and granularity as a parameter (default: month, 'M|W|D')
    who to count: three flags: collaborators, contributors, users (default: all True)
    activity should include: commits, issues, prs events - should accept list of event types to include (default: everything)
    also, accept flag to include review comments (default: True)

- (DONE) ask Bogdan to create a group and add us to that group
- (will be done naturally) include repos over 50 assignees
- (almost done) multipackage repositories - get average response variables
    for packages identified through package.json:
        use only those referring back to this repository as the project URL

- (DONE): @packages - works for single package API
- (DONE) team size using 6-month timeout is acceptable
- (DONE) number of issues and issue events: accept an optional granularity parameter (default: month)
- (in progress, GHTorrent) multi-teaming index: number of repositories for all repositories
    # account for number of active contributors (i.e. active in the last 6 months)
    # add another method to get average for all contributors  / in comments show how to make weighted average
    Instead, return a dataframe with contributors as columns, rows as months.
    Cells are number of projects they're active in,
    for those who were inactive for 6+ months it should be NaN


OLD list (safe to ignore):

TAC:
- check size of the core team
    - send an email with the distribution and decide the cutoff
- determine core members
    - check how expensive is to get people who are members/collaborators?
        - i.e. authored a first-parent commit or closed/reopened an issue
    if too expensive (unlikely), get by the amount of contributions
- scrape their activity
    - github timeline (one last year of the activity, let's start at 2017)
- calculate complexity of projects
    - build a co-commit network (since 2017 - no, actually get the full history)
    - co-commit network
        - if there is no Python implementation, Kathlen can help with her developers.
            export co-commit network into a set of CSV files
- aggregate event metrics
    - Pranav has a list of "interesting" events to count
    - also, bursiness (basically coefficient of variation / Fano factor)
? the idea is to regress it to npmjs quality/maintenance/popularity metrics
    controlling for size, team size, repo complexity etc.
