the general idea is to understand how teams guide attention focus
with the flow of incoming events, like issue reports, PRs etc.

What variables (features) affect team performance
Some features of the team/project lead to process variables
    can be in terms of temporal or structural features
        (e.g. number of labels as an indicator of issue triaging maturity)

    new concept: transactive attention control:
        how team prioritizes.

    this project:
        with the diversity of npm, test:
            - for different input conditions, under which conditions
                projects are successful (or not)
            - first, we need to separate
